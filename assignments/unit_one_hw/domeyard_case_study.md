# FinTech Case Study: [Domeyard](https://www.domeyard.com/)

Located in the heart of downtown Boston, next to the Charles River, on the 15th floor of a building that overlooks the MIT Campus, houses a newly minted high frequency trading (HFT) Hedge Fund - **Domeyard**. Domeyard's start began in the spring of 2013. Led and founded by Luca Lin, Christina Qi, and Jonathan Wang. The three came together, after meeting in classes at MIT and Harvard, with the idea to innovate in the cutthroat world of HFT.

While a small operation, the trio, by networking through their class contacts at both MIT and Harvard, gathered a stellar team of advisors and mentors. This team included former hedge fund managers and the Nobel Laureate, Robert Merton. Lin, Qi, and Wang, from their networking efforts, raised operating and trading capital to the amount of _$5m_ at the start of their hedge fund.

## The Business

- Domeyard did not have the capital to acquire high-speed data feeds, APIs, and low latency gateways. Most HFT Hedge Funds typically purchase commercial solutions for these, freeing them to focus on trading strategies instead of getting bogged down with creating their own proprietary systems.

- Domeyard needed to build hardware and trading strategies that were both _low latency_ and _high frequency_. Trading strategies that both had the ability to get information fast and act on it instantly _and_ trading strategies that frequently traded with a high turnover - thousands to millions, to even billions of trades per day.

- Due to limited capital, Domeyard had to build their own proprietary systems. From trading desks, servers, networks, and redundant backup power - these were just physical. Domeyard faced bigger obstacles like writing data feed handlers and execution gateways for the APIs in order to collect data and place orders.

```
Luca Lin saw an opportunity, stating, "if you can build a system that is optimized for each individual exchange, you can have a big latency adantage."
```

- Aside from a proprietary execution system and network infrastructure, built in-house, Domeyard also utilizes other tech stacks into their HFT fund, like:
  - C/C++ in a UNIX environment
  - Python, Bash, and shell scripting
  - Machine Learning blended with low-latency technology (some ML applications can be too slow for their HFT strategies)

## The Landscape

- The financial domain Domeyard finds itself in is the Hedge Fund Industry. Within it, its sub-domain is **high frequency trading** (HFT). Where money is made, without thinking. Success in trading is predicated on the ability to have access to relevant information about the value of an asset, then acting on _that_ information quickly. As in, faster than your competition.

- As technology progressed, electronic trading and communications evolved, making speed essential to the information of asset prices, thereby making speed essential to trade executions.

- Technological advances in communications, computers, and programming have led HFT hedge funds to dominate the capital marketplace. Accounting for 50-60% of overall trades in the capital markets, per day.

- Within this HFT niche, along with Domeyard who in reality is a newbie compared to other veteran HFT hedge funds, are:
  - Virtu Financial
  - Citadel
  - Two Sigma
  - DRW
  - Hudson River Trading
  - Tower Research Capital
  - Jump Trading
  - QuantLab Financial

## Recommendations or Final Thoughts

- Christina Qi has been vocal in her disatisfaction with the world of hedge funds. Plainly saying, they just make billionaires richer. She has also said...

```
"I grew up in a small town in northern Utah, far away from the pits of Wall Street. My parents, teachers, and role models always taught me to do something good for this world; to serve my community and the underprivileged. And yet, despite my desire to make a difference, I ended up in high frequency trading, or HFT, where I was contributing absolutely nothing to society. As I gained prominence in my industry, the cognitive dissonance grew and grew, until everything blew up. I became a Wall Street sellout - a finance snake - expanding the fortunes of the richest people in the world."
```

- Companies like Robinhood, Webull, WealthFront, and Betterment have democratized the trading of securities and getting invested in market portfolios. With this in mind, and keeping in mind what Christina Qi has said, why haven't we seen the same type of democratizing in the hedge fund industry?

- Can FinTech find solutions to have Main Street (every day people who aren't accredited investors) participate in this market and reap the same benefits large endowments, institutions, and high net-worth/ultra high net-worth individuals receive?

- Maybe someone is out there pondering on this very situation, and one day, who knows what we will see...
