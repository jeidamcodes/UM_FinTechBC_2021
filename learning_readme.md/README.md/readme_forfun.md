## **Birth**

I was born on a date. We all know it is because my parents performed a physical act but I'm not gonna talk about this. They're my parents you sickos. Plus, I have a 5 year old son who is learning to read and I really don't want him reading this crap.

Jake, I promise when you get to a certain age we will have a discussion about the birds and the bees. FYI, there aren't any :bird: and :bee:. Anyway, I am working on a secret formula to keep you forever young (cue in the _Forever Young_ Jay-Z song :headphones:, please) because you're the **coolest** 5 year old on this planet.

## **Death**

Well, we aren't there, yet. Catch me if you can.
